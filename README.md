PokeDex-App

This is a web app I wrote in Full Stack Development Course at CareerFoundry.

Built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap


Description:
The PokeDex loads data from external Pok√©API and shows details of Pokemon by clicking on a modal.
The user also can search live for a specific Pokemon.
